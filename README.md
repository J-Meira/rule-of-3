I based the application on the Material Designer system, leveraging my expertise as a senior front-end developer focusing on React with TypeScript. To streamline the development process, I utilized my own developer theme called Mui Theme, which aligns with Mui Core V6. This theme serves as a centralized resource for setting up and defining components, allowing me to efficiently manage and maintain multiple projects in a single place. If you'd like to explore the Mui Theme, you can find it at [Mui Theme](https://mui-theme.jm.app.br). This approach not only enhances consistency across projects but also simplifies maintenance, making it easier to update and customize the components as needed.
